# Coding for Journalists
### IRE16 New Orleans

A Python primer that covers how to use coding as a data journalism tool, meeting the first half of Saturday, June 18th and Sunday, June 19th.

This repo contains files that detail the fundamentals of the Python programming language; how to take a stab at scraping a web page table with a basic Python script; a guide to get rolling with Python at home or work; and more!

Check `reqs.txt` for a list of required external Python libraries. These sessions are taught in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to ease you into the coding waters without having to switch back and forth between a text editor and an interactive Python interpreter.

To get up and running with Python after the workshop, follow the instructions contained in the [install guide](/install_guide.md).

Contact Alex Richards with any questions ([alex@ire.org](mailto:alex@ire.org)).
