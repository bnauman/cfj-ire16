    "We have a list of payday lender addresses that we need to also get latitude and longitude for. While services do exist that will turn address data into coordinates, we can use a third-party Python library to bounce address information off a range of geocoding services and get back data we can use for some type of mapping or other purpose.\n",

    "Here's a rundown of how we'll solve this problem:\n",
    "- Use a library called `geopy` to run an address through Google's geocoding service\n",
    "- Use a sleep function to pause our script so we don't swamp Google and end up locked out\n",
    "- Keep track of all of our data — coming in and going out post-geocode — with a keyed dictionary\n",
    "- Put the original information AND our returned latitude, longitude and the match address (to check on the quality of the geocode) into a new CSV file\n",
